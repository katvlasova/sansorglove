# Wireless BT Sensor Glove for drawing on the web

This folder contains both the Arduino code and p5.js sketch used with my sensor glove prototype:https://vimeo.com/416807865?fbclid=IwAR0ikHytODomgMhV8qBmFRL16UmAetUvqNm-5GBUB4KMCf94_UEAaoh-GQc

The code is built on the p5.ble.js library which can be accessed here: https://itpnyu.github.io/p5ble-website/
